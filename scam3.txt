How are you and thank you for the interest. The apartment is free now
and you can start to rent as soon as possible.The apartment is located
at Sankt Peders Str√¶de 37, 1453 Copenhagen. It is a 2 bedroom
apartment; each of the room is 21m2, The rooms have a private bathroom
and toilet. There is a living room and a kitchen as well. If you rent
a room now; I will only have to get someone else to rent the other
room so that both of you can share the flat together. Possibly a lady
cos ladies are always neat and take good care of a flat. You will only
have to share the kitchen and the Living room. The rent for a room
cost 400euros monthly plus a deposit of 550 euros. The monthly rent
includes all the necessary utilities and the deposit will be returned
back to you when you are moving out from the flat.

Oh so nice when can i see it??


Good day and thanks for the response. the apartment is still free and
you can start to rent as soon as possible but sorry viewing the flat
will not be possible for now because i have left the country already
and i have the flat keys here with me, I just relocated here in
England due to my new job and that is the main reason I am renting out
the flat but I can only send you some of the flat pictures to see and
have an idea  of the flat. I will be waiting to hear from you soon.
Where are you now and what date do you intend to start renting and
move into the flat?
